        I am a full-stack web developer but don't want to limit myself to only web development. I never finished a University nor got any BS degree. Despite not being a student I am spending my lifetime learning interesting things. Other than programming I am interested in photo and video editing, math, physics, playing video games, playing football IRL and working out. Following pages try to showcase some of my knowledge and experiences.

        <p>Where are You from?</p>
        <p>I was born in Kokand, Uzbekistan üá∫üáø.</p>

        <p>Where do You live?</p>
        <p>Currently I live in Warsaw, Poland üáµüá±.</p>

        <p>What languages do You know?</p>
        <p>Uzbek is my native language. My English and Russian language skills are at a professional level.</p>

        <p>Do You have a CS degree or related one?</p>
        <p>No, I am a full self taught programmer.</p>

        <p>What's your operating system of choice?</p>
        <p>My choice of OS is Linux with that being said I used to use Windows for a long period of time and MacOS is a Unix-like OS so using all of them won't be a problem.</p>

        <p>What's your web stack?</p>
        <p>
          OS: Unix-like OS.
          <br>Databases: SQL and NoSQL.
          <br>Back-End: C++ / PHP / Python / JavaScript.
          <br>Front-End: HTML / CSS / JavaScript.
          <br><i style="font-size: 0.7em;">(Every framework / library based on the mentioned languages can be included in my stack.)</i>
        </p>

        <p>What kind of environment would You like to work in?</p>
        <p>Ideal place for me is where I am surrounded with creative minds, different thinkers who can think out of the box and push the limits and most important a place with positive vibes!

        <p>Would You like to work remotely or in an office?</p>
        <p>Each of the options has pros and cons. I personally like working from home, especially when it comes to coding. As long as we have electricity, internet connection and a laptop we can work from anywhere in the world. With that being said, when it comes to communicating with people I prefer to have a conversation in real life, physically close and most importantly eye to eye contact. In the end of the day it depends and we choose what benefits more for the people.</p>

        <p>Are You allowed to work in X country?</p>

        It all started in summer 2012, the year I got my first PC and became addicted to playing video games! I started thinking about making my own game and the journey began. Google Search and YouTube were my best friends because I hadn't got any teachers, relatives or friends who had programming knowledge. That year I discovered Java and made a simple ‚ÄúSnake‚Äù game which runs on CLI. While making the ‚ÄúSnake‚Äù game I came across a few issues. First Java was not my language. Second I started thinking about my time management because I was still playing lots of video games and I felt like wasting my time. Time management issues made me question my interest in making video games. I thought If I make a good game then it may become a source of wasting time. Finally I decided to not make games. I was thinking how to direct my knowledge for the better. At that time ‚ÄúFacebook‚Äù was famous and their simple idea was ‚ÄúConnecting People‚Äù. I loved their website but found a few missing pieces to make ‚ÄúFacebook‚Äù a masterpiece and again I came back to my good old friends Google Search and Youtube. I searched a lot on how to make a simple website later I found that PHP is the language to go (Still 2012) if I want to build websites. Yeah PHP is good. I liked it. Learned language syntax then started cloning ‚ÄúFacebook‚Äù from scratch. While building my social network I faced new challenges. So far I never worked with databases but in social networks everything is data. I needed to learn how to store data, access, update and delete it. I found MySQL, later understood, all SQL databases are similar. I forgot to mention about HTML, CSS, JavaScript (Simple Vanilla JS no frameworks yet). I learned just enough of the front-end languages to make my website look good. Meanwhile I made one commercial static website which was my first income (I am still in college). Entering to Web Development introduced me to new doors, new programming languages, new challenges most importantly my vision became broader. I didn't stick only to PHP. I was playing with C/C++, Assembly, NodeJS, and Python . Desktop apps were interesting to make and use them compared to web browsers so I was thinking of integrating my website to a desktop app. When I was bored of coding I always played with Photoshop. It was my second biggest interest at that time. I was so interested in video editing but my PC wasn't powerful enough to handle high performance tasks so I left that field for the future. My main focus was on web development. At that time I didn't know Front-End or Back-End names. I just build anything to make it work. I tried Python‚Äôs Flask. I liked it. It was so fast to finish the projects but not the best performance on production. I tried NodeJS for the back-end. It was smooth but I didn't like using JavaScript as a backend language. I tried every new trend because I didn't want to be left behind. Vue, React, Cordova for Mobile, Electron For Desktop almost every new trend. So Yeah this is my "Journey To Programming".
