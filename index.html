With that being said, when it comes to communicating with people I prefer to have a conversation in real life, physically close and most importantly eye to eye contact. In the end of the day it depends and we choose what benefits more for the people.</p>

		It all began in the summer of 2012 when I got my first computer and got hooked on playing video games. I started dreaming of creating my own game, and that's when my journey started. Since I didn't have any teachers, relatives, or friends who knew programming, Google Search and YouTube became my best buddies.

		In that year, I stumbled upon Java and crafted a simple "Snake" game that ran on the command line. However, I faced a couple of issues - firstly, Java wasn't my forte, and secondly, managing my time became a challenge as I was still engrossed in playing video games. This made me question whether making games was worth my time, fearing it might be a source of wasting precious moments. Eventually, I decided to shift my focus.

		Around that time, "Facebook" was gaining popularity with its simple idea of "Connecting People". Inspired by their concept, I sought to improve it by filling in some missing pieces. Once again, Google Search and YouTube came to my rescue. I delved into PHP, the language of choice for website building in 2012. I liked PHP, learned its syntax, and began cloning "Facebook" from scratch.

		Creating a social network brought forth new challenges. While I had never worked with databases before, social networks revolved around data. I had to learn how to store, access, update, and delete data, leading me to MySQL. I also picked up HTML, CSS, and simple Vanilla JS to make my website visually appealing.

		In the midst of this, I developed a commercial static website, marking my first income while still in college. Web development opened new doors, introducing me to different programming languages and challenges. I ventured beyond PHP, exploring C/C++, Assembly, NodeJS, and Python. Desktop apps caught my interest, prompting me to consider integrating my website into a desktop application.

		When I needed a break from coding, I turned to Photoshop, making it my second significant interest. Although I was fascinated by video editing, my PC lacked the power for high-performance tasks, leading me to postpone that field for the future. Web development remained my primary focus.

		At that time, I didn't know the terms Front-End or Back-End; I just built things to make them work. I experimented with Python's Flask and liked its speed for project completion, even though it didn't offer the best performance on production. I also tried NodeJS for the back-end, finding it smooth but disliking JavaScript as a back-end language. I embraced every new trend, from Vue and React to Cordova for Mobile and Electron for Desktop. And this is my "Journey To Programming."
