          Hi! I am Yahya. I like building things whether it's a web app or a desktop app or editing photos or videos. I build whatever pleases. I am a full-stack web developer in spite of that I don't want to limit myself to only web development. I have solid knowledge on Photoshop, Premiere Pro. I never finished a University nor got any BS degree. Despite not being a student I am spending my lifetime learning whatever is interesting. I am interested in photo and video editing, math, electro physics, playing video games, playing football IRL and workout. Following pages try to showcase some of my knowledge and experiences. Next page is all about Q & A. If You can't find an answer to your question feel free to contact me.

        <p class="observerTarget">
          How did I fall in love with programming? It all started in summer 2012 which is the year I got my first PC and became addicted to playing video games! I started thinking about making my own games and my journey began. On my programming journey Google Search and YouTube became my best friends because I didn't have any teachers or relatives or friends who are familiar with programming. So that year I discovered Java and made a simple ‚ÄúSnake‚Äù game which runs on CLI. While making the ‚ÄúSnake‚Äù game I came across a few issues. Java was not my language. I started thinking about my time management because I was still playing lots of video games and I felt like wasting my time. Time management issues made me question my interest in making video games. I thought If I make a good game then it may become a source of wasting time. Finally I decided to not make games. I was thinking how to direct my knowledge for the better. At that time ‚ÄúFacebook‚Äù was famous and their simple idea was ‚ÄúConnecting People‚Äù. I loved their website but found a few missing pieces to make ‚ÄúFacebook‚Äù a masterpiece and again I came back to my good old friends Google Search and Youtube. I searched a lot on how to make a simple website later I found that PHP is the language to go (Still 2012) if I want to build websites. Yeah PHP is good. I liked it. Learned language syntax then started cloning ‚ÄúFacebook‚Äù from scratch. While building my social network I faced new challenges. So far I never worked with databases but in social networks everything is data. I needed to learn how to store data, access, update and delete it. I found MySQL later understood once You learn SQL all databases are similar. I forgot to mention about HTML, CSS, JavaScript (Simple Vanilla JS no frameworks yet). I learned just enough of the front-end languages to make my website look good. Meanwhile I made one commercial static website which was my first income (I am still in college). Entering to Web Development introduced me to new doors, new programming languages, new challenges most importantly my vision became broader. I didn't stick only to PHP. I was playing with C/C++, Assembly, NodeJS, and Python . Desktop apps were interesting to make and use them compared to web browsers so I was thinking of integrating my website to a desktop app. When I was bored of coding I always played with Photoshop. It was my second biggest interest in computers. I was so interested in video editing but my PC wasn't powerful enough to handle high performance tasks so I left that field for the future. My main focus was on web development. At that time I didn't know Front-End or Back-End names. I just build anything to make it work. I tried Python‚Äôs Flask. I liked it. It was so fast to finish the projects but not the best performance on production. I tried NodeJS for the back-end. It was smooth but I didn't like using JavaScript as a backend language. I tried every new trend because I didn't want to be left behind. Vue, React, Cordova for Mobile, Electron For Desktop almost every new trend. Finally I decided to go from scratch for everything because while using new frameworks or languages I saw pros and cons so I wanted to eliminate minuses and keep the pluses. I made my own front-end framework with vanilla JavaScript and I made my own server using C++ and I included my backend language to my server to make it so performant.
